# CodSoft Internship
I, Shryansh Parashar from Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, have successfully completed all the tasks give by CodSoft as a part of my internship in Python Programming starting from 15 December 2023.
I certify that the code is completely mine and there has been no plagiarism.

## Completed Tasks :
- #### Task 1 - Create a ToDo List in Python<br>
  I used Tkinter to create a simple but interactive GUI.

- #### Task 2 - Create a Simple Calculator in Python<br>
  Again used Tkinter to make it interactive, instead of CUI, made a GUI version of what I made a few years back.

- #### Task 3 - Password Generator in Python<br>
  Only program which didn't require a GUI, took character dataset from `string` library.

- #### Task 4 - Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Python<br>
  Another replica of my previous projects, made a similar game for my Discord Bot.

- #### Task 5 - Address Book in Python<br>
  An interactive Address Book in Python using Tkinter and used Pillow for image processing, created this program last year and now improved.
